# H2politO Git Workshop 

Welcome to Team H2politO! This repository is a **practice playground** where
you'll learn:

- the basics of **git**: commits, history, and **branches** (one branch per feature)
- keeping a branch up to date with **merge** and **rebase**
- **how we work as a team** (trunk-based development)
- **GitHub**: forking, protecting `main`, and opening **pull requests**

The code is a tiny Python program called `ecotrack` that prints lap statistics
for our Shell Eco-marathon car. It is very simple, and it has a few small bugs
and missing features for you to work on. **You can't break anything here**, so
experiment freely.

> **First time with git?** Perfect, so is almost everyone in the room. Follow the
> guides in order and ask a mentor whenever you get stuck.

---

## Before the workshop (at home, ~30 min)

Complete **[docs/00-prerequisites.md](docs/00-prerequisites.md)**:

1. Install git and Python
2. Create a GitHub account
3. Configure git, and set up a global ignore file for your editor's junk files
4. Create an **SSH key** and add it to GitHub
5. **Clone** this repository and run the program

Stuck? Come 15 minutes early and we'll fix it together.

```

Run it from this folder:

```bash
python3 -m ecotrack data/sample_laps.csv      # on Windows: python -m ecotrack data/sample_laps.csv
```

Look closely at the output. Something is wrong…  (That's task T1 in
[docs/05-tasks.md](docs/05-tasks.md).)

<details>
<summary>Optional: run the tests yourself</summary>

GitHub runs the tests automatically on every pull request, so you don't have to.
If you're curious:

```bash
python3 -m pip install pytest
python3 -m pytest
```
